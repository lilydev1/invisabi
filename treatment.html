        <h1>Treatment</h1>
        <p>The following drugs have been prescribed for the benificial effects they have on the behavioural symptoms caused by the damage to brain cells.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">
          <b>Ebixa</b> (Memantine Hydrochloride)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">
        <b>Epilim</b> (Sodium Valproate)
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Dementia</h2>
 <p>Dementia describes a collection of symptoms that are caused by disorders affecting the brain. It is not one specific disease. Dementia causes the (usually gradual) loss of mental abilities such as thinking, remembering and reasoning.<br>
</p>
<p>Dementia develops when cells in the parts of your brain involved with mental ability become damaged. Damage to these cells can be caused by
  diseases and infections that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer’s disease or meningitis.</p>

      <h2>Cholinesterase inhibitors</h2>
 <p>The new generation of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) were originally developed to improve memory and the ability to carry out day-to-day living activities in people with Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that these drugs also have slight beneficial effects on behavioural symptoms, particularly apathy (lack of drive), mood and confidence. Taking cholinesterase inhibitor drugs may therefore reduce the need for other forms of medication. However, in higher doses these cholinesterase inhibitor drugs may occasionally increase agitation and produce insomnia with nightmares.
</p>
<p>Memantine is the most recent antidementia drug to be developed. It works in a different way to the anticholinesterase drugs and is the first drug approved for those in the middle to later stages of Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
</p>
<p>There is some evidence that memantine has a positive effect on mood, behaviour and agitation. <br>       
</p>  
<p>Anticonvulsant drugs, such as sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are sometimes also used to reduce aggression and agitation. 
</p>

<h2>Absence seizures</h2>
<p>Different epilepsies are due to many different underlying causes.
  A structural (sometimes called 'symptomatic') change in the brain, such as the brain not developing properly, damage caused by a brain injury, or infections like meningitis.
  </p>
 <p>If you are having a typical absence seizure, you will be unconscious for a few seconds. You will suddenly stop doing whatever you were doing before it started, but will not fall. You might appear to be daydreaming or ‘switching off’, or people around you might not notice your absence. 
</p>
<p>Sodium valproate is an epilepsy drug prescribed for all seizure types including absence, myoclonus and tonic clonic seizures.
